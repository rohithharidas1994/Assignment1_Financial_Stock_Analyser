GenAI Architect Assignment 1

Steps to run the notebook:
1. Run the 3 cells under the block of `Pre-requisite Setup`. This includes installing/importing your pre-requisite libraries and configuring mlflow server
NOTE: I'm utilizing the `genai` venv and the common API key as specified in `.env`
2. Run the 7 cells under the `Pipeline Scripts` block.
NOTE: You can uncomment the commented cells to explore individual chain specific outputs
3. Under the final section i.e. `Run end-to-end pipeline`, update the `COMPANY_NAME_TO_ANALYSE` field to your desired company(except Tesla) and run the cell to generate the sentiment analysis report.
